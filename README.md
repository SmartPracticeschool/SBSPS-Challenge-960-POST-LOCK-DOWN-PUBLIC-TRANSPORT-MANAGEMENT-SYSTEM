Abstract: (Problem statement)

In India, there about 120-150 million passengers use public transport daily. Keeping this pandemic time in mind, “social distancing “and “contactless transportation payment” are the principal factors to be considered while using public transit. An intelligent application that enables the digital transaction for transportation fees. Once the payment is done a monthly transportation pass in terms of QR(quick response) code will be purveyed to the passenger. When a passenger boards the public bus he/she has to scan the respective QR code which will check the validity of the digital pass and updates the bus occupancy. The application platform advises the user about the approaching bus occupancy rate. For railway purposes instead of a common jetton, a common QR code scanner will verify the passenger's digital pass validity. The application informs the passage about the occupancy of the incoming train and endorses the user about the compartment which has a low occupancy rate. And also helps the government authorities to spot out the cram-full areas

The above project is based on maintaining social distancing while travelling in public transit
